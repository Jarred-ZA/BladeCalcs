# BladeCalcs
A python program to run analytical and simple Fem calculation on NACA blade profiles

The Naca blade profiles are generated by a python libary (naca.py) originally by Dirk Gorissen.

Geomertic properties are determaied
approximations, exact solutions and numerical solutions are provided
A,Ix,Iy,Txy,Cx,Cy

Pysical Properties can be entered
E,rho [Pa,kg/m^3]

Idealised Beam caluctionas are done
lumped mass
distributed mass
Euler Bunullie clamped -Free
Natural Frweqancies and Mode Sapes are computed

Blade properties can be entered
% twist and rotation point(Center of Gravity).

3D blade is plotted.
Blade profile is plotted with twist
Mode Shapes are plotted
